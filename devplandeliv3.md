<h3> Dev Plan </h3>


We have a plan.

It is as follows.

We made tickets, and put it on our scrum board.

The tickets involve:

(1) One ticket to research parse5.
- One ticket to generate the nodes to parse.
- One ticket to take information and store in object/interface that we will make.
- One ticket to create tests for parsed information (this way we can parallelize).

(2) Improve valid key coverage with new keys.

(3) One ticket to create send/receieve geocode request.
- Also need to include mocked service request with this.
- Can be run in parallel to anything else since we can check the functionality via the tests.

(4) Bug tickets.
- Probably some edge case bug tickets will get reported because of the above tickets.

(5) Further tickets
- Break down earlier tasks into more tickets if the tasks become too large.
