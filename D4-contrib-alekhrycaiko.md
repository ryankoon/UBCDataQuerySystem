<h2> Aleks Contribution for D3: </h2>

<h3> Code contributions: </h3>

I contributed by:

- setting up webpack
- setting up react
- setting up typings for new packages
- setting up and implementing a bootstrap front-end
- creating  the react components and table functionality to query, display and handle errors/successes from API contact.
- i basically did most of the front-end for this deliverable, I split the end facebook bit with ryan. My facebook
contributions included setting up the initial SDK, creating an app, connecting an app and allowing that app to
send notifications to a specific user. I also setup the local storage solution that initially made this possible
and was built upon.
- did some back-end to set up API endpoints that allowed me to populate the dropdown for the forms.

other contribs:
- our scrumboard.
- planning
- worked with ryan to parallelize our development the best we could.
