<h2> D2 Contributions - Ryan Koon </h2>

<h3> Code Contributions </h3>

Since features are often heavily broken down into multiple commits, these are links to the pull request of the feature branches.
These branches represent key contributions more than a single commit would in our case.

https://github.com/CS310-2016Fall/cpsc310project_team52/pull/38/commits

3. Order  
https://github.com/CS310-2016Fall/cpsc310project_team52/pull/42/commits  
New implementation of order

4. Group  
Wired up with Apply functionality and added new behaviour throughout the query
process (group, apply, order, build) to add support for D2 specifications while
maintaining backwards compatibility to D1.
Examples include handling custom keys on build results, when to collapse results or get values defined in GROUP and
APPLY.
