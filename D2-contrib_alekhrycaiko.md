Contribution for D2:

D2 workload allocated to myself included:


Code contributions:

(1) Re-factoring current code to implement InsightFacade alongside providing adequate test coverage.
(2) Completing APPLY for the query implementation and providing test coverage
(3) Identifying and attempting to fix test coverage concerning our really low branching score (I Still have a branch
unmerged concerning this since it removes catch clauses that were worried about causing breakages - although probably its fine).
Most of these changes involved specific issues with promises not having error cases tested sufficiently in datasetcontroller.

Rather then specific commits, I have branches that are outlining the above.

Non-code contributions

- Worked with Ryan in-person in order to conceptualize how we can take the implementation of APPLY and use it
to implement GROUP (since apply depends on group).
- Worked online with Ryan concerning bugs with the validity of an empty APPLY (JAGUAR).
- Managed scrum board and created a series of tickets outlining the approach we should be taking for completion of this
deliverable/sprint.
- Provided feeback on developed features in terms of JavaScript best-practices and approach.
