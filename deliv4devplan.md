Our dev plan:
Make tickets (done).
Setup react (done)
Setup webpack (done)

We then want to setup routes (done)
Split up work into four major tickets
(1) For course scheduler
(2) For room scheduler
(3) For peoples schedule maker
(4) For the NG Hard question with fb notificatioons.


We will parallelize and make one of us do #1 and #2 while another does #3 in order to more quickly finish this deliverable
and unblock the potential of working on 4; since the fb notifications problem depends on the schedule generator being compelted.
